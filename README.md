# Distributed Task Manager with Raft Consensus

This is a task management application that leverages the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. The backend is built using Python's Streamlit framework and MySQL to store task data.

## Key Features:

- **Raft Consensus Algorithm**: The application uses the Raft consensus algorithm to coordinate task management operations across a distributed system, ensuring data consistency and fault tolerance.
- **MySQL Backend**: Tasks and related data are stored in a MySQL database, providing a scalable and reliable storage solution.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks through a user-friendly Streamlit interface.
- **Distributed System Principles**: The application demonstrates distributed system principles such as consensus, replication, and failover.

## Technology Stack:

- **Backend**: Python, Streamlit, Raft Consensus Algorithm, MySQL
- **Communication**: gRPC
